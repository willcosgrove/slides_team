When I'm rejected
When I'm depressed

When I have fears
that keep my soul from rest

I remember
what Jesus did

When he carried
my sorrows to his death

Oh the darkness won't survive



When I'm offended
When I'm oppressed

When I have tears
streaming down my chest

I remember
what Jesus did

When he carried
my sorrows to their death

Oh the darkness won't survive



And I know in the shadows
you won't let me down

When the darkness surrounds me
you won't let me down

No I won't be afraid
You won't put me to shame

No you won't

Oh the darkness won't survive



When I am anxious
When I'm a wreck

When I have fears
of the future in my head

I remember
what Jesus did

When he lifted
my heart from every death

Oh the darkness won't survive



And I know in the shadows
you won't let me down

When the darkness surrounds me
you won't let me down

No I won't be afraid
You won't put me to shame

No you won't

Oh the darkness won't survive



You've delivered us
You've delivered us from darkness

You've delivered us
You've delivered us from darkness

You've delivered us
You've delivered us from darkness

You've delivered us
You've delivered us from darkness

Into the kingdom of God forever
And so we lift our voices together

And our souls cannot be taken
Because your kingdom cannot be shaken

And with Christ on the throne forever
We will praise his name forever

And our hope cannot be taken
Because your kingdom cannot be shaken

Oh the darkness won't survive
